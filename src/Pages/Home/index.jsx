        <h2>Notice to Client</h2>
        The Grateful Shed is aware of the mysterious contagious disease that is affecting
        dogs across the U.S. and is showing symptoms of kennel cough or canine influenza.
        Please be on the lookout for signs of upper respiratory illness in your dog. If
        your dog is showing signs of sneezing, coughing, lethargy, nasal and/or eye
        discharge please contact your veterinarian. <br /><br/> These infections are common
        and can easily be transmitted between animals. Vets are recommending that you
        should avoid dog parks, boarding, or groomers that have multiple dogs. At The
        Grateful Shed, we only accept dogs from the same family at one time. Our cleaning
        policy includes cleaning the bus and all instruments after each client. <br /><br/> We
        want our customers to feel assured that we will take great care of your dogs and
        will do everything in our power to prevent any illnesses. If you have any
        questions or concerns, please contact Laura 801-696-2233.
