        Happy One-Year Anniversary! ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for sharing your furry friends with me
        over the past year. I&apos;m excited to celebrate this milestone with all of you!
        I&apos;d like to let everyone know that, moving forward, I will no longer be
        accepting new clients north of Spanish Fork. Please rest assured that this change
        does not affect any of my existing clients. Thank you for your understanding and
        continued support!

          bringing grooming to your doorstep; it&apos;s about providing the undivided
          attention and personalized care that your cherished companion deserves. Welcome
