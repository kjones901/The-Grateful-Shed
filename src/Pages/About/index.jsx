            <PawIcon /> Hi,
          </AboutMeTitle>
          I would like to introduce myself. My name is Laura Hartman and I LOVE DOGS!
          According to my Mom, the first word I ever spoke was Dog! I deeply love all
          animals and considered becoming a veterinarian.<br/><br/> I followed a different path and
          became a nurse. I have worked in the operating room helping to heal people for
          close to 30 years. I am so excited and pleased to announce that I have
          started a whole new chapter in my healing caregiver role. I&apos;ve switched my focus
          back to dogs. I want to help dogs live their happiest, healthiest, most stylish
          lives possible!<br/><br/> When your beloved furry friend is in my care they will be
          treated with love just like my own dog Odin. ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂‚ù§Ô∏è
